# EMEL - Parking Guide

My final project for the mobile development subject. The main objective of the application is to provide the user with information regarding the nearest parking lots in the Lisbon area. 
It is a native application that uses the Kotlin language.
It also supports local database usage via SQLite.
All the data is provided via the following api: https://emel.city-platform.com/opendata/
